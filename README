second.c is implemented using even sized pointers i.e even if the pointer is 20 bit we consider the whole 24 bits i.e 3 bytes as the pointer.

trie1.c is implemented using odd sized pointer i.e if the pointer is 20 it is used as 20 bits and the next pointer will start from 21st bit.

words contain the list of words to be inserted and checked.
second.c is bit incomplete. but will run.

to compile run make.
	$make
to run second.c
	$./second words tt        
	here tt is the file where you will get the various statistics about node types and count of them
to run trie1.c //by manpreet
	$./trie1 words $(wc -l wrods) < words
